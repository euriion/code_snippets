# Scala example codes

This is a space for Scala language example codes.
Recenllty, I started studing Scala language. but It's too hard to remember gramar and structure of syntax.
So, I store example codes for my future remind.
These codes are from `Scala cookbook - o'reilly` book. but they have a little bit modificiation for my own reason and some codes have comments written in Korean.

* exam1.scala - basic examples
* file1.scala - file handling
* file2_control.scala - file handling 2
* pattern1.scala - regular expression and pattern match and extraction
* test.csv - sample csv file for file examples
